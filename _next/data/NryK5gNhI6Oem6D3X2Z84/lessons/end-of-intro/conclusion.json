{"pageProps":{"post":{"attributes":{"description":"A quick note and congratulations from Brian for completing the Complete Intro to React v6!"},"html":"<p>This concludes our intro to React! You know now nearly every feature of the React core library (there are a few more but are rarely needed.) What makes React wonderful is not only the core library itself but the ecosystem around. Indeed, the ecosystem around it is as much a reason to learn React as React itself.</p>\n<p>The modules following this one are considered to be optional modules: you don&#39;t need to know all of these; you can just pick the ones you need for your project or what interests you the most and leave the others behind. For the most part these modules will be self-contained: you don&#39;t need to complete all the optional modules to understand what&#39;s going on. Some <em>will</em> use the code you built in the previous modules here but feel free to clone the complete project and work from there.</p>\n<p>Good job getting this far and good luck on the next modules!</p>\n","slug":"conclusion","title":"Conclusion","section":"End of Intro","icon":"stopwatch","filePath":"/home/runner/work/next-react-v6/next-react-v6/lessons/07-end-of-intro/A-conclusion.md","nextSlug":"/next-react-v6/lessons/end-of-intro/ways-to-expand-your-app","prevSlug":"/next-react-v6/lessons/special-case-react-tools/portals-and-refs"}},"__N_SSG":true}
