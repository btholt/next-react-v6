If not, there&#39;s a brief section on it <a href=\"/next-react-v6/redux-getting-started\">here</a>. <code>useReducer</code> allows us to do Redux-style reducers but inside a hook. Here, instead of having a bunch of functions to update our various properties, we have one reducer that handles all the updates based on an action type. This is a preferable approach if you have complex state updates or if you have a situation like this: all of the state updates are very similar so it makes sense to contain all of them in one function.</p>\n","slug":"usereducer","title":"useReducer","section":"Hooks in Depth","icon":"search","filePath":"/home/runner/work/next-react-v6/next-react-v6/lessons/09-hooks-in-depth/E-usereducer.md","nextSlug":"/next-react-v6/lessons/hooks-in-depth/usememo","prevSlug":"/next-react-v6/lessons/hooks-in-depth/useref"}},"__N_SSG":true}
